tori a_1 "You can chill V. It's me."
vanessa "..."
vanessa "I trust you, but I'd like a proof."
john a_15 "E-Everything is okay ?"
tori "Remember in the city bar when we got dumped because I high kicked that waiter who was hitting on me ?"
vanessa b_7 "... Fine."
john a_15 "..."
tori b_6 "Hey John. Instead of looking at me like I'm going straight out of a fucking UFO, would you not rather tell me what the fuck happened with that nerd ?"
john "I-I don't know ! We were sat here with Vanessa, we wanted to have some spare time before lunch, and he went back with a knife, screaming and then you arrived."
vanessa b_3 "He ... He almost stabbed me ..."
tori b_0 "..."
"Well, she is John's stalker with Vanessa's memories ... the hate of seeing John with someone else, plus the fact that she was with him so far, plus the hate of Vanessa being Kiyoshi ..."
"She just totally lost it I guess ... And she is actually a fucking danger."
john b_2 "I don't understand why he did that ..."
john "I know you don't really like him, but he isn't that ..."
vanessa "Yeah, yeah. We know."

"I remembered that my mouth actually sucked Mallory's dick !"
vanessa a_6 "You okay Tori ?"
tori a_0 "No. Gotta get rid of a taste. Wanna move your fucking asses to lunch, or stay hidden there ?"
john "It ... applies to me ?"

tori a_1 "I didn't forbid you, dumbass."
john a_0 "O-Okay then !"
john a_2 "But what about him ?"
tori a_8 "Ah yeah ... fuck ..."
"I could also lock him in Mallory's office, but I don't want that sequestering people becomes a habit ..."
"I'm not sure I have enough energy for a hypnosis neither. Transforming is too much demanding."
"Also, I'd rather not tell the truth to John. That's bad, but Vanessa would dump him if John knows that Vanessa doesn't really love her."
"And I'd like that Vanessa gives him a chance ... Seeing him protecting her confirms all the good I think about him."
tori a_1 "Get to lunch. Imma deliver this crazy ass nerd to nursery. I'll say he missed a step in stairs."
john "You sure it's a good idea ?"
tori a_0 "If you have an other idea Mr Genius, don't hesitate to share it."
john "..."
tori "Then, that's set."
"I carried him (or better say her) on my back, and went to the nursery."
